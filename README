This program uses a template transition matrix, or one that you create on your own 
in order to tokenize and validate input from the user.

These files contain the following things:

    tm.1               the sample TM from the assignment writeup
    tm.2               a slightly modified version of tm.1

    input.1            the sample input from the assignment writeup
    input.2            a larger, multi-line test input file

    output1.1          output using tm.1 and input.1
    output1.2          output using tm.1 and input.2
    output2.1          output using tm.2 and input.1
    output2.2          output using tm.2 and input.2
